# ReadMe

This project builds a very basic web server written in Ruby (based off https://practicingruby.com/articles/implementing-an-http-file-server). As a web developer, even though I use HTTP technologies everyday I have a very limited understanding of how HTTP works under the hood.  Completing this project gave me a much better understanding of the underlying fundamentals of HTTP communication.

# Future Work
- Add support for PUT requests
